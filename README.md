Oh this ol' thing? It's just a little object oriented JavaScript I cooked up for fun. Ya know in between building open source microservice generators and ending poverty. 

This simple implementation of tic tac toe uses only jQuery and keeps track of the current state of the game with the interface. Therefore the model, view and controller are all mixed together in a not-so-great way. A Backbone version is coming soon to a repo near you (namely, this one).
